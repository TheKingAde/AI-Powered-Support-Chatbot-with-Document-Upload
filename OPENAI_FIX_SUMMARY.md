# OpenAI "proxies" Error Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The application was failing with the following error when trying to run `app.py`:

```
TypeError: Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'
```

This error occurred during the initialization of the OpenAI client in `services/ai_service.py` at line 19.

## Root Cause
The issue was a **version compatibility problem** between:
- `openai==1.53.0` (the originally specified version)
- `httpx>=0.26` (a dependency that was auto-installed)

The newer versions of the OpenAI library were passing a `proxies` argument to the `httpx.Client` constructor, but newer versions of `httpx` no longer accept this argument.

## Solution Applied

### 1. OpenAI Library Downgrade
- **Changed from:** `openai==1.53.0`
- **Changed to:** `openai==1.40.0`
- **Reason:** Version 1.40.0 is more stable and compatible with the available httpx versions

### 2. HTTP Client Version Constraint
- **Added:** `httpx<0.26`
- **Reason:** Ensures compatibility with the OpenAI library's proxy argument usage

### 3. Updated Other Dependencies for Python 3.13 Compatibility
- **pandas:** Upgraded to `>=2.3.1` (was `2.2.0`) - for Python 3.13 compatibility
- **numpy:** Upgraded to `>=2.3.1` (was `1.26.0`) - required by pandas
- **scikit-learn:** Upgraded to `>=1.7.0` (was `1.4.0`) - for Python 3.13 compatibility

## Updated requirements.txt

```
Flask==2.3.3
flask-cors==4.0.0
openai==1.40.0
httpx<0.26
PyPDF2==3.0.1
pandas>=2.3.1
openpyxl==3.1.2
pillow==10.4.0
pytesseract==0.3.13
python-docx==1.1.2
numpy>=2.3.1
scikit-learn>=1.7.0
python-dotenv==1.0.0
werkzeug==2.3.7
```

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Use the Virtual Environment (Recommended)
1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install the fixed dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set your OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### Option 2: Fix Existing Installation
If you already have packages installed, you can fix the versions:

```bash
pip uninstall openai -y
pip install openai==1.40.0
pip install "httpx<0.26"
```

## Verification
To verify the fix is working, you can test the OpenAI client initialization:

```python
import os
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'your-api-key'
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()
print("✅ OpenAI client initialized successfully!")
```

## Key Points
- ✅ **Fixed:** The `TypeError: Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'` error
- ✅ **Compatible:** Works with Python 3.13
- ✅ **Tested:** All services (AIService, FileProcessor, VectorStore) initialize correctly
- ✅ **Stable:** Uses proven compatible versions

## Notes
- The fix maintains all original functionality
- No code changes were required - only dependency version updates
- The application should now run without the initialization error
- Make sure to set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before running
